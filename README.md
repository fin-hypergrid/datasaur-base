# datasaur-base

Abstract base class for Hypergrid "datasaur" (data source) modules.

This module is the successor to fin-hypergrid-data-source-base (which will no longer be maintained).

datasaur-base@3.0.0 implements data source interface with fallbacks and deprecates Data Controllers. (All support for Data Controllers has been removed from Hypergrid as of version 3.0.0.)
